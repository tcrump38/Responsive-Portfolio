                <p>I am an eager and intrepid learner. I have been dabbling and cultivating coding and web 
                    development skills for a time now. I started an elemental Wordpress blog for health and 
                    dieting but am sinking my teeth deeper into the nuts and bolts of programming on the web.</p> 
                    <p>I am a graduate of Texas Tech University and have made Austin my home now for almost 3 years. 
                    My background is in sales and trading, specifically freight-brokering. My family and I have 
                    set roots in Austin and have taken full advantage of the many bike trails through out the 
                    city. My Brittany Spaniel, Graham, has taken full advantage of the amazing dog parks that can 
                    be found. We love it here and I plan on improving the experience with a career change into web 
                    development!</p>
